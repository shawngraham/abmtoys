## ABM Toys

Agent based models can be a kind of hermeneutica of the kind argued for by Stefan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell in their book 'Hermeneutica: Comoputer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities'.

This repo is for a series of little toys with which to explore aspects of Roman archaeology, society, economics, and history.

Experiment notes etc will be kept in my [open notebook](http://smgprojects.github.io).
